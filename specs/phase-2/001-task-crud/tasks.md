# Tasks: Task CRUD Operations

**Feature**: Task CRUD Operations
**Branch**: `001-task-crud`
**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/phase-2/001-task-crud/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/task-api.md

**Tests**: No explicit test requirements in specification - focus on functional implementation

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story?] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Web app structure**: `backend/` and `frontend/` directories at repository root
- Backend: `backend/app/` for application code
- Frontend: `frontend/src/` for source code

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and monorepo structure setup

- [x] T001 Create monorepo structure with backend/ and frontend/ directories
- [x] T002 [P] Initialize FastAPI project in backend/ with UV package manager

- [x] T005 [P] Setup backend/.env with DATABASE_URL, JWT_SECRET, CORS_ORIGINS
- [x] T006 [P] Setup frontend/.env.local with NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete. This phase depends on authentication feature (002-user-authentication) being implemented first.

**Dependencies**:
- User model/table must exist (from 002-user-authentication)
- JWT authentication middleware must exist (from 002-user-authentication)
- Better Auth must be configured (from 002-user-authentication)

### Backend Foundation

- [x] T007 Create Task model (TaskBase, Task, TaskCreate, TaskUpdate, TaskRead) in backend/app/models/task.py
- [x] T008 Update User model to include tasks relationship in backend/app/models/user.py
- [x] T009 Create Alembic migration 002_create_tasks_table.py for tasks table with indexes
- [x] T010 Run database migration to create tasks table in Neon PostgreSQL
- [x] T011 Create task router structure in backend/app/routers/tasks.py with empty endpoints
- [x] T012 Register task router in backend/app/main.py
- [x] T013 [P] Create helper functions validate_user_id() and get_task_or_404() in backend/app/routers/tasks.py
- [x] T014 [P] Configure CORS middleware to allow frontend origin in backend/app/main.py

### Frontend Foundation

- [x] T015 [P] Create Task TypeScript interfaces in frontend/src/types/task.ts
- [x] T016 [P] Create Zod validation schemas (taskCreateSchema, taskUpdateSchema) in frontend/src/lib/validations/task.ts
- [x] T017 [P] Create API client functions (getTasks, getTask, createTask, updateTask, toggleTaskCompletion, deleteTask) in frontend/src/lib/api/tasks.ts
- [x] T018 [P] Install and configure react-hot-toast for notifications in frontend/

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Create New Task (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Enable users to create new tasks with a title and optional description, establishing the foundational capability for the todo application

**Independent Test**: Navigate to task creation interface, enter a valid title (1-200 characters) and optional description (max 1000 characters), submit the form, and verify the task is created with "pending" status and appears in the task list

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Update Task Details (Priority: P4)

**Goal**: Enable users to edit task title and description to correct mistakes or add more information as needs change

**Independent Test**: Create a task, click the edit button, modify the title and/or description in the edit form, save changes, and verify the updates are reflected in the task list

**Acceptance Criteria**:

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion AND authentication feature (002-user-authentication) - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order: US1 → US2 → US3 → US4 → US5
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Requires tasks to exist (from US1/US2) for testing
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Requires tasks to exist (from US1/US2) for testing
- **User Story 5 (P5)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Requires tasks to exist (from US1/US2) for testing

### Within Each User Story

- Backend endpoints before frontend components (API must exist)
- API client functions before UI components (client functions needed by components)
- Core components before integration (TaskForm/TaskItem before dashboard)
- User Story 1 should be complete before heavy testing of US3-US5 (need tasks to exist)

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Backend and Frontend sections)
- Backend and Frontend foundational work can proceed in parallel
- Once Foundational phase completes, User Stories 1 and 2 can start in parallel
- User Stories 3, 4, and 5 can start in parallel after US1 creates at least one task
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members
- All Polish tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# These backend tasks can run in parallel (different responsibilities):
Task T019: "Implement POST endpoint"
Task T020: "Add request validation"
# (Then T021-T023 follow sequentially)

# These frontend tasks can run in parallel (different files):
Task T024: "Create TaskForm component in frontend/src/components/tasks/TaskForm.tsx"
Task T025: "Add form validation with zod schema"
Task T026: "Create task creation page in frontend/src/app/tasks/new/page.tsx"
```

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 2

```bash
# These frontend tasks can run in parallel (different files):
Task T037: "Create TaskItem component in frontend/src/components/tasks/TaskItem.tsx"
Task T038: "Create TaskList component in frontend/src/components/tasks/TaskList.tsx"
Task T039: "Add responsive layout with Tailwind"
Task T040: "Add empty state UI"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 + 2)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - requires authentication feature complete first)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Create Task)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (View Tasks)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test creating and viewing tasks independently
6. Deploy/demo if ready (basic task management working)

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (can create tasks!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP complete - create + view!)
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (can mark complete)
5. Add User Story 4 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (can edit tasks)
6. Add User Story 5 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (full CRUD complete!)
7. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Create)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (View)
3. After US1/US2 complete:
   - Developer A: User Story 3 (Toggle)
   - Developer B: User Story 4 (Update)
   - Developer C: User Story 5 (Delete)
4. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Task Summary

**Total Tasks**: 104
- Setup: 6 tasks
- Foundational: 12 tasks (8 backend, 4 frontend)
- User Story 1 (Create): 12 tasks
- User Story 2 (View): 16 tasks
- User Story 3 (Toggle): 12 tasks
- User Story 4 (Update): 16 tasks
- User Story 5 (Delete): 12 tasks
- Polish: 18 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 42 tasks marked [P]

**Independent Test Criteria**:
- US1: Can create tasks with title and description
- US2: Can view all tasks with status filtering
- US3: Can toggle task completion status
- US4: Can edit task title and description
- US5: Can delete tasks with confirmation

**Suggested MVP Scope**: User Stories 1 + 2 (Create + View tasks)

**Format Validation**: ✅ All tasks follow checklist format with checkboxes, IDs, optional [P] and [Story] labels, and file paths

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Authentication feature (002-user-authentication) MUST be implemented before starting Foundational phase
- User model, JWT middleware, and Better Auth configuration are prerequisites
- Verify user_id filtering on all database queries for security
- Test optimistic UI updates for toggle and delete operations
- Follow responsive design principles (mobile-first with Tailwind breakpoints)
